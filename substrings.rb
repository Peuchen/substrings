require 'pry'

#Create a method that aks for one or more words as the first argument and an array of substrings (the dictionary) as the second argument
#Create a hash
#Split the first argument
#Check the first argument's words on the presence of the substrings in the second argument
#If the substring is not present in the hash, add it and assign '1' to it
#If the substring is already present, add 1 to its assigned number in the hash
#When all of the words are evaluated, return the hash
